
Energy performance measures : Solar Thermal Collectors

Installation of a solar thermal system to get hot water to power showers and kitchen.

Comparison between a solar thermal collector and a PHE system with steam:


Data:

Solar thermal panels:
  12 Panels solar thermal concentrators of 1 [m2] each
	Temperature: 60-70 [ºC]
	Pressure internal circuit: 3 [bar]
	Pump circulation PtMax: 115 [W]
	Constant flow circulation: 1 [m3 / h]
	Reservoir: 2 [m3]
	Closed water circuit with antifreeze
	Piping 1 "

Circuit PHE exchanger steam – water
	Reservoir: 0.3 [m3]
	Pump circulation: 200 [W]
	Exchanger plates: 200x400 [mm]
	Vapour pressure: 1.5 [bar]

Service water supply circuit (common to Solar thermal panels and steam -water circuit)
	Diameter: 1 1/4''
	Average water temperature input: 20 [º C]
	Minimum output temperature: 40 [º C]
	Pressure: 2.5 [bar]
	Flow: depends on the consumption and use of showers rooms and the kitchen (it is considered a total daily intake of 2 [m3])


Operation Mode:

Before
	Before the installation of this system, the heating water resorted to the use of steam, using, exclusivity a Plate Heat Exchanger (PHE).


After
	Assembly of solar panels that allow replacing the existing PHE exchanger, and the use of a smaller PHE which uses lower steam flow to heat the water when there is no sun.
